        <p>
          I am currently a joint JD/Ph.D. in Political Economics student at the Law School and Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am broadly interested in the areas of election administration, immigration law, and race, ethnicity, and politics.
          My past and current research has used large-scale administrative data and survey/field experiments to 
          investigate <a style="color:#005cf5">how elections polarize voters</a>, <a style="color:#008000">trade-offs in political representation</a>, 
          and <a style="color:#FF0000">negativity on turnout</a>. 
          See <a href="research.html">Research</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          I received my A.B. in Government (with High Honors) and Quantitative Social Sciences, <i>summa cum laude</i>, from Dartmouth College in 2022. 
          I then completed my pre-doctoral fellowship with Professors Gregory Huber and Alan Gerber at Yale University, where I helped co-author a variety of papers on
          political economics and political behavior.
