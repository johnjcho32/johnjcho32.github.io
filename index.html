          I am currently a <a href = "https://tobin.yale.edu/people/john-cho">Pre-Doctoral Fellow</a> at Yale University, 
          working with Professors Alan Gerber and Gregory Huber. 
          I will be applying to PhD programs in Political Science for the Fall 2024 academic year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am broadly interested in the areas of REP, political behavior, and elections, especially pertaining to the political representation 
          of pan-ethnic groups such as Asian Americans/Latinos and the effect of election laws on voting behavior. 
          My past and current research has used large-scale administrative data and survey/field experiments to 
          investigate <a style="color:#005cf5">how elections polarize voters</a>, <a style="color:#008000">trade-offs in political representation</a>, 
          and <a style="color:#FF0000">negativity on turnout</a>. 
          See <a href="research.html">Research</a> for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recieved my A.B. in Government (with High Honors) and Quantitative Social Sciences, <i>summa cum laude</i>, from Dartmouth College in 2022. 
          I have also taken a wide variety of upper-level undergraduate and graduate classes in mathematics and statistics at 
          Yale University from 2022-2024.
          See <a href="classes.html">Classes</a> for more details.
