          <p>This course introduces mathematical and statistical models in the social sciences beyond the level of bivariate regression. Topics to be covered include multivariate regression, selection bias, discrete choice, maximum likelihood models, multi-level modeling, and experiments. We will use use these models to study voter turnout, elections, bargaining in legislatures, public opinion, political tolerance, the causes and duration of wars, gender bias in employment, educational testing, poverty and income, and a host of other topics. Students will write a paper of original research using some of the methods covered in class.

          <li><b>MATH/QSS 30.04:</b> Evolutionary Game Theory and Applications (Spring 2022)</li>
          <details><summary>Course Description</summary><br>
          <p>Pioneered by John Maynard Smith and others, evolutionary game theory has become an important approach to studying a wide range of biological and social problems, such as microbial interactions and animal behavior. In evolutionary game dynamics, the fitness of individuals depends on the relative abundance of all individual types in the population, and higher-fitness individual types tend to increase in abundance. This course introduces basic concepts in evolutionary game theory, including evolutionarily stable strategies, replicator dynamics, finite populations, and games on networks, along with applications to social evolution, particularly to understanding human cooperation.

            <p>The study of human language from a computational perspective. This accelerated course has programming background equivalent to that provided by COSC 1 as a prerequisite. This course will survey formal models for representing linguistic objects, and statistical approaches to learning from natural language data. We will pay attention to the use of computational techniques to understand the structure of language, as well as practical engineering applications like speech recognition and machine translation. Students will implement simple algorithms for several key tasks in language processing and learning.

            <p>This course is an introduction to Python programming and database (SQL) programming and design for intermediate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users. This course teaches students to design and write clearly structured programs in Python in the ArcGIS environment. Students will develop programs to manage geospatial data, perform geoprocessing analysis to solve spatial problems, and automate mapping and visualization tasks. This course emphasizes the challenges and uniqueness of spatial data organization from specific database models to national spatial data infrastructures. Students gain theoretical and practical experience in designing, implementing, and managing geo-relational and object-relational databases.
