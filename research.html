            <details><summary>Abstract</summary><br>
            <p>Policies that promote the common good may be politically infeasible if legislators rep- resenting “losing” constituencies are punished for failing to promote their district’s welfare. We investigate experimentally how varying the local and aggregate returns to a policy affects voter support for their incumbent. In our first study, we find that an incumbent who favors a welfare-enhancing policy enjoys a discontinuous jump in support when their own district moves from losing to at least breaking even, while the additional incremental political returns for the district doing better than breaking even are modest. This feature of voter response, which we replicate, has significant implications for legislative politics generally and, in particular, how to construct polit- ically feasible social welfare enhancing policies. In a second study, we investigate the robustness of this finding in a competitive environment in which a challenger can call attention to a legislator’s absolute and relative performance in delivering resources to their district.</p></details>

        <details><summary>Abstract</summary><br>
        <p>Scholars have extensively studied whether campaign attack advertisements&mdash;messages that attack individual candidates&mdash;mobilize or demobilize voters with mixed results. We argue that group-oriented partisan affect in campaigns&mdash;messages about the parties in general&mdash;is just as important given increasing trends of affective polarization. We use two survey experiments, one right before the 2020 presidential election and the other before the subsequent Georgia Senate runoff election, to examine the effects of partisan rhetoric on several measures of civic engagement. In the presidential election, neither positive partisan, negative partisan, nor personal apartisan appeals had a statistically significant effect on voters’ enthusiasm, likelihood to volunteer, or likelihood to seek out more information about engaging in the election. In the second study, negative partisan appeals led registered voters in Georgia to report much higher levels of enthusiasm about their preferred candidate, but this result was driven by Republicans only. The findings contribute new insights about electoral context and asymmetric affective polarization to the literature documenting the mobilizing effects of negativity in campaigns.

            <details><summary>Abstract</summary><br>
              <p> In three survey experiments conducted before, during, and after the 2020 Election, we investigated subject beliefs about the frequency of different threats to election integrity and their emotional reactions to these problems. In these studies, we assessed beliefs about and reactions to counting fraudulent votes (fraudulent), failing to count legitimately cast ballots (uncounted), and causing those who were eligible to vote to forgo doing so (foregone). On average, Republicans believe the first two types of errors are both more frequent and more troublesome than do Democrats, with the opposite pattern for forgone votes. Over time, these partisan gaps in beliefs grow only for frequency of fraudulently counted ballots, while Republicans becoming relatively more concerned about the seriousness of all types of errors. These results hold in a vignette describing the same errors with multiple features (Study 2) and when respondents had to choose ex ante between election rules (Study 3). Overall, these three studies contribute to a better understanding of voter beliefs about and reactions to potential threats to election security.

            <details><summary>Abstract</summary><br>
              <p>We study voting lines in Florida during early in-person voting and on Election Day, focusing on who stands next to whom at the polls using voter check-in data. The extent of geographic sorting and political polarization in the United States means that voters who cast their ballots on Election Day likely stand next to individuals who have similar partisanship. That is not as true of early voters, though, as they can choose from among the early voting polling location in their counties. This provides us with an opportunity to investigate the consequences of partisan polarization for possible political dialogue by voters standing in line to vote. We consider whether lines reinforce polarization or provide an opportunity for discussion of partisans with different opinions.

          <details><summary>Abstract</summary><br>
            <p>How do minority voters prioritize shared race, ethnicity, and partisanship for who represents them in Congress? Asian Americans, as the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, present an important case study to analyze trade-offs between descriptive and partisan representation. In addition to considerations about partisanship, Asian Americans face trade-offs between candidates of the same national origin and of the same race. We find that when asked outright about collective presence in the legislature, Asian Americans prioritize increased descriptive representation over partisan representation. However, when choosing between candidates for dyadic representation, Asian Americans often trade off descriptive representation for the sake of shared partisanship. Voters are only willing to cross party lines for a co-ethnic representative, but not for pan-ethnics. The findings have important implications for how ethnic minority voters make decisions about political representation and contribute to understandings about a heavily understudied and heterogeneous group.
